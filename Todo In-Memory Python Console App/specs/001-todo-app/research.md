# Research: Todo Application Implementation

## Decision: Python CLI Framework Selection
**Rationale**: For the command-line interface, Python's built-in `argparse` module is the most appropriate choice as it's part of the standard library, well-documented, and provides all necessary functionality for our simple CLI requirements without adding external dependencies.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Click: More feature-rich but adds external dependency
- Typer: Modern alternative but also adds external dependency
- Plain sys.argv: Less structured but possible

## Decision: In-Memory Storage Implementation
**Rationale**: Using a Python list to store Task objects in memory is the simplest approach that meets our in-memory storage requirement. The list will be managed by the TaskService class.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Dictionary with ID as key: More efficient lookups but more complex
- Class attribute on TaskService: Simple and clean approach

## Decision: Task ID Generation
**Rationale**: Using a simple auto-incrementing integer ID generated by tracking the maximum ID in the current list is the simplest approach that ensures uniqueness without complex logic.
**Alternatives considered**:
- UUID: More complex for a simple integer ID requirement
- Timestamp-based: Less intuitive for users to reference tasks

## Decision: Testing Framework
**Rationale**: pytest is the most popular and well-supported testing framework for Python, with excellent documentation and features that support both unit and integration testing.
**Alternatives considered**:
- unittest: Built-in but more verbose
- nose: Less actively maintained than pytest

## Decision: Project Dependencies
**Rationale**: For a simple CLI todo application with in-memory storage, we can implement all required functionality using Python's built-in modules (argparse, dataclasses, etc.) without external dependencies.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Adding CLI frameworks like Click or Typer: Would add unnecessary complexity for this simple application
